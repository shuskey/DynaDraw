BUG FIX / IMPROVE
[ ] Jet Rotation follow directional Vector - Fix the Y axis Flip issue
[ ] Shooter will shoot backwards at certain angles

[X] A Z within ( ) is doing something strange
[X] Program letters ( ) c [ ] missing from list of Keyboards
[X] Host this myself on AWS at photoloom.com/dynadraw - now runs on iOS devices
[X] Local save goes away every time I republish to itch.io - would a static URL help?
[X]    Perhaps look at hosting this myself
[X] Cursor position visual only appears after a text update, should always be visible
[X] Cursor not shown when edit field looses focus
[X] Globe resource has a Cyan haze in Webgl version
[X] Webgl Sharable - Share icon - Create URL with Dyna String + accept Dyna String on URL
[X] Turn Cursor Cones off when 'show controls' are OFF

	======

    ======
Dev OPs:
[X] Deploy script to automated new code release deploys
[ ] Cross link Itch.io to Photoloom ??
[ ] Return to compressed deploy files with Unity fixes it
[ ] versioning of static web content to assit with cache refresh
[ ] Git tagging or some other 'previous version' reference/storage
[ ] Code cleanup
[ ] Unit Tests
[ ] Deployment pipeline script: Build, Test, Promote, Deploy Release Candidate, then Release Candidate promote to release
	
New Features:
[ ]  Add a version or date to the home screen or titles
[X] Implement on screen keyboard(s)
    - start with a simple Backspace, left arrow, right arrow, Delete, Letter 
	- Multi panels: Quotables, Rotation and Motion, Objects, '... modifiers' (()[]zZ0-9C)

-->[ ] Auto insert second (paired) quotes when someone starts typing a string this way the text shows up right away
-->[ ] Slow down I speed, as in [IW] world spins too fast
-->[ ] Need stronger "K" light emitions to light up more stuff

[ ] Other types of joints
	- Rag Doll dangle
[ ] Lighting options - Dark, spot light, or other lighting/fog settings
[ ] Add other cool 3D Objects: - make discoverable - so easy to add
         Parameters: Assigned Letter "W", auto pilot rotate to direction true/false
		 color settable, shooter offset/direction
	 - Fruit
	 - Flower
	 - Coin like color disks
	 - Transparent
	 - IDX Logo
	 - Lights
[ ]	Press/hold starts action (spin/spray/lights/lengthen) release stops
[ ] Other Particle Physics effects
	 - Smoke
	 - Sparkle
	 - Water Hose
[ ] Make several different extendable Arm styles
	 -X Cube based
	 - Neon (light saber)
	 - Rounded and cylinder
	 - Robot arm style
	 - Transperent
	 - Other
[ ]	Prefabs that make noise (sound) - try it
[ ] Allow a second camera to be droped into the mix - Go for a Ride!
[X] Need instructions on Photoloom/dynadraw page (quick HTML) - did pdf
[X] Need local save of my masterpieces to include Scene Settings: currentSceneName, , fieldOfView, timeScale
[X] Speed Slider needs beter ability to choose slow motion - right now its hard to get a slowed setting
[X] Cooler, more interesting horizon/environment
[X] Titlers and shooters should have a specific "look"
[X] Add instructional graphics for keyboard and gamepad shooter/tilter usage
[X] add Arrow kb control to tilt control
[X] Add 3D Text of some kind
[X] Gamepad/Keyboard Controls (Triggers) - embedded into prefabs
	 X Shoot Canon
	 X Tilt control
[X] Over All Controls:
	 X Pause Animation
	 X Change Speed of animation
	 X Clear (clear text field)
	 X Save (save current text) - perhaps using cookies for web publish version
	 X Camera position (near/far)	
[X] Put into GITHUB source code control
[X] Publish a version to the Web
	 ------
	 
[ ] Higher level language construct - Single Letters are a bit limiting
	 - Allow for Trigger/Modifier/Thing/Action
	 Perhaps this is like Dominion (Card Game) Cards
	 
	 Trigger types:
		 None: Action happens continualy
		 On Press Do action once
		 On press toggle action on/off
		 On Hold toggle action on
		 Scaler value that can go up and down
		 Scaler, Scaler - two degress of control - probably two axis rotation
	 Modifier/Action:
		 Zoom = Scaler (direction/scalse) Constant, cycling in/out or from Trigger
		 Color = Scaler (color, intensity) Constant, rainbow cycle, from trigger
		 (rotaters only) Rotation Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, continuous rotation, or from Trigger
		 (arms/moves only) Length Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, cycling in/out, or from Trigger
	 Thing/Action
		 Particle: physics 	on/off, scaler adjuster (color, intensity)
		 Light:				on off (color, intensity)
		 Move:				direction positive/negative, length
		 Arm:(choose type):				direction positive/negative, length + color
		 Rotater:			
		 Sound:
		 Camera: Broadcast Camera 2 from here
		 3DObject: (lots) - centered - listens to Zoom and rotation - no translation movement
		  - Self orienting object (jet) is one type
		  
		  Move()
		  Move().Length(Trigger)
