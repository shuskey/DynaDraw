[X] Cleaned up a Mobile 'View/Interact mode only'
[X] A Z within ( ) is doing something strange
[X] Program letters ( ) c [ ] missing from list of Keyboards
[X] Host this myself on AWS at photoloom.com/dynadraw - now runs on iOS devices

Depricated:
[-] On Screen KB is depricated. On screen keyboad fails to scroll when end of edit box hit
[-] Depricated - Need? KBs that work on Mobile Phones
    - Not left-right scrollable
	- Multi panels only a few visible at once:
		Quotables, Rotation and Motion, Objects, '... modifiers' (()[]zZ0-9C)
[-] Auto insert second (paired) quotes when someone starts typing a string this way the text shows up right away
    I Tried and failed - Unity InputField limitations
	
----
	
[ ] Higher level language construct - Single Letters are a bit limiting
	 - Allow for Trigger/Modifier/Thing/Action
	 Perhaps this is like Dominion (Card Game) Cards
	 
	 Trigger types:
		 None: Action happens continualy
		 On Press Do action once
		 On press toggle action on/off
		 On Hold toggle action on
		 Scaler value that can go up and down
		 Scaler, Scaler - two degress of control - probably two axis rotation
	 Modifier/Action:
		 Zoom = Scaler (direction/scalse) Constant, cycling in/out or from Trigger
		 Color = Scaler (color, intensity) Constant, rainbow cycle, from trigger
		 (rotaters only) Rotation Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, continuous rotation, or from Trigger
		 (arms/moves only) Length Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, cycling in/out, or from Trigger
	 Thing/Action
		 Particle: physics 	on/off, scaler adjuster (color, intensity)
		 Light:				on off (color, intensity)
		 Move:				direction positive/negative, length
		 Arm:(choose type):				direction positive/negative, length + color
		 Rotater:			
		 Sound:
		 Camera: Broadcast Camera 2 from here
		 3DObject: (lots) - centered - listens to Zoom and rotation - no translation movement
		  - Self orienting object (jet) is one type
		  
		  Move()
		  Move().Length(Trigger)
