BUG FIX / IMPROVE
[ ] Webgl not running on ios Mac/Safari
[ ] Webgl not running on iPad
[ ] Find out from itch.io how to pass parameters into the Web App from the itch.io URL
[ ] Local save goes away every time I republish to itch.io - would a static URL help?
    Perhaps look at hosting this myself
[ ] Jet Rotation follow directional Vector - Fix the Y axis Flip issue
[X] Cursor position visual only appears after a text update, should always be visible
[X] Cursor not shown when edit field looses focus
[X] Globe resource has a Cyan haze in Webgl version
[X] Webgl Sharable - Share icon - Create URL with Dyna String + accept Dyna String on URL
[X] Turn Cursor Cones off when 'show controls' are OFF

	======
	
New Features:
[X] Titlers and shooters should have a specific "look"
[X] Add 3D Text of some kind
[ ] Other types of joints
	- Rag Doll dangle
[ ] Cooler, more interesting horizon/environment
[ ] add WASD kb control to tilt control
[/] Over All Controls:
	 X Pause Animation
	 X Change Speed of animation
	 X Clear (clear text field)
	 X Save (save current text) - perhaps using cookies for web publish version
	 X Camera position (near/far)
	 - Lighting options - Dark, spot light, or other lighting/fog settings
[X] Put into GITHUB source code control
[X] Publish a version to the Web
[ ] Add other cool 3D Objects: - make discoverable - so easy to add
         Parameters: Assigned Letter "W", auto pilot rotate to direction true/false
		 color settable, shooter offset/direction
	 - Fruit
	 - Flower
	 - Coin like color disks
	 - Transparent
	 - IDX Logo
	 - Lights
[ ] Gamepad/Keyboard Controls (Triggers) - embedded into prefabs
	 X Shoot Canon
	 X Tilt control
	 - Press/hold starts action (spin/spray/lights/lengthen) release stops
[ ] Other Particle Physics effects
	 - Smoke
	 - Sparkle
	 - Water Hose
[ ] Make several different extendable Arm styles
	 -X Cube based
	 - Neon (light saber)
	 - Rounded and cylinder
	 - Robot arm style
	 - Transperent
	 - Other

[ ]	Prefabs that make noise (sound) - try it

[ ] Allow a second camera to be droped into the mix - Go for a Ride!
	 ------
	 
[ ] Higher level language construct - Single Letters are a bit limiting
	 - Allow for Trigger/Modifier/Thing/Action
	 Perhaps this is like Dominion (Card Game) Cards
	 
	 Trigger types:
		 None: Action happens continualy
		 On Press Do action once
		 On press toggle action on/off
		 On Hold toggle action on
		 Scaler value that can go up and down
		 Scaler, Scaler - two degress of control - probably two axis rotation
	 Modifier/Action:
		 Zoom = Scaler (direction/scalse) Constant, cycling in/out or from Trigger
		 Color = Scaler (color, intensity) Constant, rainbow cycle, from trigger
		 (rotaters only) Rotation Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, continuous rotation, or from Trigger
		 (arms/moves only) Length Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, cycling in/out, or from Trigger
	 Thing/Action
		 Particle: physics 	on/off, scaler adjuster (color, intensity)
		 Light:				on off (color, intensity)
		 Move:				direction positive/negative, length
		 Arm:(choose type):				direction positive/negative, length + color
		 Rotater:			
		 Sound:
		 Camera: Broadcast Camera 2 from here
		 3DObject: (lots) - centered - listens to Zoom and rotation - no translation movement
		  - Self orienting object (jet) is one type
		  
		  Move()
		  Move().Length(Trigger)
