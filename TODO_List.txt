BUG FIX / IMPROVE
[ ] Shooter will shoot backwards at certain angles
[ ] Would be nice if shooter cannon balls took on the current color
[ ] Left/Center/Right Justification, Horiz/Vert Words, Disk Face/Edge/Clock options for text orientation
[ ] Jet Rotation follow directional Vector - Fix the Y axis Flip issue
[ ] Allow a Shooter to be applied to the Rocket
[ ] why is www.photoloom.com api queries (like list published) cached - I do not seen new adds
[ ] move instructions button to a green circle "i" button
[ ] move share and new "publish to gallery" button to a "box with arrow' - iPhone style share icon
    [ ] When pressed the use gets the option to choose - "share URL" or publish to gallery

New Features - Higher Priority:
-->>[ ] Post to be reiviewed, add "Publish to Gallery" button on Edit Page for potential Publishing (may ask for additional details Text/image)
    Only allowed if you are logged in.  A record gets created in the dynadraw-gallery table via the Api Gateway/Lambda "/api/gallery/review - POST" call

[ ] continue as Guest, login/signup (just need unique/verified email)
    [X] Webgl  [ ] Apply the below learnings back into the WebGL version
    [X] Create Serverless for DynaDraw table/APIs  - Modify the Pets Sample code - Commited as DynaDraw-Gallery in GitHub
        [X] make this deploy to my custom domain - see https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain
    [ ] UWP - cognito login how?? - Incorporate sample code back into Unity App - look for Unity Resources in the Unity Store - perhaps https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/login-module-16120#releases	
	    [X] Sample code working - fixed backend cofiguration issues
	    [/] Need UWP AWS .Net Sdk working to get Auth token for logged in user and pass this along with API Post call

				    [X] Need to be able to make distinction between Admin and Member users
        
		
		[XX  Question  ] how to get Cognito_DynaDraw_UserRole by default for PhotoloomPool UserPools?? - [Answer -  Well - we will let these just authenticate with no roll/group]
		[XX  Question  ] how to enable Role base Authorization - OR do I have it with the policies attached to the roles??  ===> Lambda Authorizer is the ANSWER [Answer - add Admins to cognito group, use Lamba custom authorizer] 
		[XX  QUESTION  ] How to get my lambda python code with import 'from jose import jwk, jwt' to work??? [Answer - Serverless is the answer]
		     
[ ] Acceptance Criteria: Use/setup Authentication to enforce business rules
    [X] Anyone can get/read Published Gallery Items - Auth None
	[X] Only logged in users can add (Post) to be Reviewed Gallery Items - serverless custom Lambda Authorizer
	[X] Only Admin can read Review Gallery Items - serverless custom Lambda Authorizer
	[ ] Only Admin can update Gallery Items - 
	    for example update a Review to a Published Items (add additional text/iamge fields)
		or Review to a Trash item
		or set fields on Published items (featured flag, etc)
	 
[ ] GALLERY - Public Gallery for sharing:
[ ] Need a YouTube like, player for Gallery Items (play only) with Edit Launch button that brings it in to your local storage 
[ ] need to keep attribution - original author, based on "original title" etc

Completed
------
[X] Startup splash / menu Welcome screen

[X] Implement on screen keyboard(s) (depricated)
    - start with a simple Backspace, left arrow, right arrow, Delete, Letter 
[X] Deploy script to automated new code release deploys
[X] Scene Transitions that kind and gentle - the current "360 Spin" is too much
[X] Cleaned up a Mobile 'View/Interact mode only'
[X] A Z within ( ) is doing something strange
[X] Program letters ( ) c [ ] missing from list of Keyboards
[X] Host this myself on AWS at photoloom.com/dynadraw - now runs on iOS devices
[X] Local save goes away every time I republish to itch.io - would a static URL help?
[X] Perhaps look at hosting this myself
[X] Cursor position visual only appears after a text update, should always be visible
[X] Cursor not shown when edit field looses focus
[X] Globe resource has a Cyan haze in Webgl version
[X] Webgl Sharable - Share icon - Create URL with Dyna String + accept Dyna String on URL
[X] Turn Cursor Cones off when 'show controls' are OFF
[X] Need instructions on Photoloom/dynadraw page (quick HTML) - did pdf
[X] Need local save of my masterpieces to include Scene Settings: currentSceneName, , fieldOfView, timeScale

	 ------
Depricated:
[-] On Screen KB is depricated. On screen keyboad fails to scroll when end of edit box hit
[-] Depricated - Need? KBs that work on Mobile Phones
    - Not left-right scrollable
	- Multi panels only a few visible at once:
		Quotables, Rotation and Motion, Objects, '... modifiers' (()[]zZ0-9C)
[-] Auto insert second (paired) quotes when someone starts typing a string this way the text shows up right away
    I Tried and failed - Unity InputField limitations
	
----

How about a multi-line program editor which also includes auto complete

---
	
[ ] Higher level language construct - Single Letters are a bit limiting
	 - Allow for Trigger/Modifier/Thing/Action
	 Perhaps this is like Dominion (Card Game) Cards
	 
	 Trigger types:
		 None: Action happens continualy
		 On Press Do action once
		 On press toggle action on/off
		 On Hold toggle action on
		 Scaler value that can go up and down
		 Scaler, Scaler - two degress of control - probably two axis rotation
	 Modifier/Action:
		 Zoom = Scaler (direction/scalse) Constant, cycling in/out or from Trigger
		 Color = Scaler (color, intensity) Constant, rainbow cycle, from trigger
		 (rotaters only) Rotation Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, continuous rotation, or from Trigger
		 (arms/moves only) Length Amount = direction, Scaler Constant, cycling in/out, or from Trigger
	 Thing/Action
		 Particle: physics 	on/off, scaler adjuster (color, intensity)
		 Light:				on off (color, intensity)
		 Move:				direction positive/negative, length
		 Arm:(choose type):				direction positive/negative, length + color
		 Rotater:			
		 Sound:
		 Camera: Broadcast Camera 2 from here
		 3DObject: (lots) - centered - listens to Zoom and rotation - no translation movement
		  - Self orienting object (jet) is one type
		  
		  Move()
		  Move().Length(Trigger)
		  		  
Spruce up list
Running in editor mode:
 X Make the main menu buttons look cool again - perhaps like the Logout/Quit buttons
 - Login brings up a Dialog Box for Credentials - what is it doing now?
 - Music on Credits Screen
 X Hello Guest & Login Button need to be layed out side by side on "ClassicDraw" & "Gallery"  {Login} Hello Guest
 
 - Get Publish to work:
 UnityEngine.EventSystems.ExecuteEvents.Execute[T] (UnityEngine.GameObject target, UnityEngine.EventSystems.BaseEventData eventData, UnityEngine.EventSystems.ExecuteEvents+EventFunction`1[T1] functor) (at Library/PackageCache/com.unity.ugui@1.0.0/Runtime/EventSystem/ExecuteEvents.cs:272)
UnityEngine.EventSystems.EventSystem:Update() (at Library/PackageCache/com.unity.ugui@1.0.0/Runtime/EventSystem/EventSystem.cs:501)

Test in WebGL Mode...
FIX: 
#IF at login routine?
X  Quit Button does not belong on "Editor Mode" run, nor WEBGL
X  Redirect to https://photoloom.com/dynadraw/index.html?code=4dc54dea-5632-40ed-978a-cefb50c38926
   After login (via web service) does not work, in web console output:
   Aws Credentials for code=, retrieved from /idbfs/1d8c9a6596ffdf7547009a9d840885f0/DynaDrawCredentials
X Login button on Draw and Gallery Screen does nothing

WebGL:
(Done) Logout needs to eliminate the "?code=d61d8e83-fca1-4f45-ab98-69c2ca2d3984" from the url
(Fixed) Login not working
(fixed) - Opening a new Browser Tab (perhaps this is a Unity Problem)

(Fixed) https://dynadraw.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/error?error=Required+parameters+missing&client_id=6gb9lmh1ntv2l22s75snucik6n
(Fixed) Because it is making this call:

(Fixed) ->Redirect_Uri is null

Stand alone (UWP) Mode:
Do not call out to Web Link
Need my own Login dialog box
